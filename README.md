# Hello all!

- I am Jeffrey Chandler and I'm currently a research analyst at University of Montana studying future vegetation transitions and wildfire risk.
- I would say I'm a quantitative landscape ecologist that want's to bridge the gaps between forestry, wildlife biology, paleoecology, and disturbance ecology.
- I'm particularly interested in leveraging the full gambit of statistics and computer programming to analyze ecological relationships over space and time, notably quasi novel non-parametric methods, robust models, ensemble models, and simulation models.
- My masters quantified the spatial aspects of fire-regime departure across western US forested landscapes, and I hope to translate it into broader questions concering the influence of fire exclusion on fire-regime departures and how biodiversity may respond.

# Skills

- I am a proficient programmer in R, Python, and Julia, particularly in spatial analysis, modeling, simulation, and statistics (6 years of experience).
- I am comfortable with High Performance Computing, particularly on cluster networks. 
- I leverage open source software to the fullest extent, and I **highly** recommend you do too.
- I'm competenent in C, C++, Javascript (mostly the Google Earth Engine API), and ArcGIS Pro (although the world will be better without ESRI).
- I am also a proficient teacher's assistant/tutor, having been one for 6 different courses.

# Contibutions

- Starting up the DPL.jl project, a Julia port of dpl from openDendro. Just need the time (and funding) to get it to a workable and useful place.
- I've also helped the GeoStats.jl ecosystem, particularly with adding functionality to move it towards a full fledged GIS.
- I've helped manage, consult, and demonstrate useful data management and coding practices (although I'm always learning more).
